## My process

- Started with mapping out what content needed to be grouped together ex. class-info, class-description, author-info.
- Added in content then worked on positioning of the blog preview card with flexbox. A lot of the elements like the headers and paragraphs are positioned on the left anyway so there wasn't a lot of positioning needed. Mainly focused on the position of the card and centering. Went back and forth this is process a lot.
- Added in stylistic elements like font sizes, font family, etc.
- Figured out how to position the attribution section underneath the card with flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned about the fit-content property for the class-label, and that helped out a lot! I wanted it to fit only the text and not have it fill the entire container, so using this property was great for doing that.
- Gained more practice with max-width and how to combine that with flexbox properties. Sizing and positioning is still difficult for me to wrap my head around when first starting a project so reviewing max-width was helpful in making this a more responsive project. It allowed me to keep the size as the screen got bigger. Still confused about min-width however and what properties I should add when the screen goes below 320px.

### Continued development

- Need more practice with responsive images and fitting them into the div they are in.
- Still need to practice positioning elements on a page and thinking of that first before adding in everything else.
- Need more practice with moving from mobile-first design to desktop. I didn't add a max-width at first with my mobile design, and was left confused with how it would stretch and look different when I changed the screen size.
